# How Things Are Being Checked

This is the "script" I use to get a feel for how far you've gotten. I'll ask you to:

1. Open up the `ex-01/index.html` doc in Live Server and pop open the devtools console. I should see something very close to this: 
   
   ![desired output](instruction-images/ex-01.png)

2. Take a quick look at the code for `ex-01/index.js`. How do things look? 
   - good naming?
   - is at least one shorthand property name used for the Hitchhiker's Guide used?

3. Open up the `ex-02/index.html` doc in Live Server and pop open the devtools console. I should see something very close to this: 
   
   ![desired output](instruction-images/ex-02.png)

2. Take a quick look at the code for `ex-02/index.js`. How do things look? 
   - good naming?
   - is at least one shorthand property name used for the Hitchhiker's Guide used?
   - are any of the console.logs hardcoding things (like size or startingColours) that they shouldn't?
