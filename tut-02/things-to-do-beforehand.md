# Things To Do Beforehand

Here's what you should do before tut-01.

## Install (or update) Node

_Although we won't be using Node directly for assignments, a number of the extensions you will use in VS Code depend on it._

- If you have a version earlier than LTS 16.13.1, then you should update your installation; otherwise download and install the LTS 16.13.1 version of Node from [the official download site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
  - Use the 64-bit msi if you're on a Windows machine. Accept all defaults.
  - Use the 64-bit macOS binary if you're on a Mac.
  - If you're on a Linux box, I assume you know what to do here.


## Install (or update) VS Code

_We'll be using this as our default editor for both JavaScript and PHP this semester. If you're married to some other editor, I won't stop you from using it - but I also won't provide any support if you have any problems using your editor of choice!_

- If you have a version earlier than 1.63.whatever, then you should update your installation; otherwise download and install the latest version from from [the official download site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
  - If you're on a Windows machine, I strongly suggest choosing the **System Installer** and making sure you use [these options](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45075883) during installation.
  - If you're on a Mac, you should choose the version that (Intel or Apple Silicon) that matches up with your machine.
  - If you're on a Linux box, you can figure it out.

### additional extensions

After installing/updating VS Code, install the following extensions:

- [ ]  [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [ ] [Markdown Preview GitHub Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)
- [ ] [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [ ] [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [ ] [Webhint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webhint.vscode-webhint)
- [ ] [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [ ] [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

### useful VS Code settings

The next two settings make formatting a snap; I'm assuming you can find out how to do these settings on your own. If you need some help, I've done a [short screencast](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/s1Dr6MFiMltfeHAmaHBq) [2:29] that goes through the process. (You'll need to log in with your mymru gmail account to access the screencast.)

1. Editor: Format On Save (checked)
2. Prettier: Require Config (checked)

## GitHub Skills

For every tutorial, coding quiz, and assignment, you're going to follow the same basic workflow:

1. accept a GitHub Classroom assignment (Classroom calls **everything** an assignment), thus creating a GitHub repo you have access to
2. clone that GitHub repo to a local repo
3. work work work
4. commit the changes to your local repo
5. push the changes back up to GitHub

If you're new to the process, or need a refresher, you can check out [this screencast](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/Cr1lJvL3xKuWBRZZ5VtY) [13:39]

## VS Code Skills

Three things you'll be doing over and over again in VS Code are:

1. previewing markdown (md) documents
1. using Emmet shortcuts
1. opening html files you're editing in Live Server

You can either figure these out for yourselves (a good thing), or if you need a little help, here's [another screencast](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/vcksQTM93FnccXJUJYpM) [5:21].

## Devtool Skills

You'll be living in the devtools a lot. Some skills that are fundamental are:

1. opening an Incognito browser window
1. inspecting a webpage
1. inspecting specific elements on a web page
1. opening a console
1. using the device toolbar to display a webpage at different device sizes

Yup. [Screencast](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/6nOCOsPdFuH30PeKjA6K) [4:04] if you want it.
