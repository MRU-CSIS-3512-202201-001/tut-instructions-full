#### Notes

Here's why we use these extensions:

- `Markdown All in One` & `Markdown Preview GitHub Styling` let you view markdown files (md extension) the way they are seen on GitHub instead of plain old "editor view".
- `Live Server` gives us an easy way to view changes in our markup and JavaScript, since the page is updated every time we save our work.
- `ESLint` & `Webhint` help us catch common mistakes in markdown and JavaScript as we work
- `Prettier` & `EditorConfig for VS Code` make sure that our code follows standard formatting practices, making code easier to read for you and your instructor
