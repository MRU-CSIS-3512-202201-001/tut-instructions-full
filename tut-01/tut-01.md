# Tutorial 01: Acclimatization

**2022-01-10 (M)**

## Overview

You'll be doing a lot of coding in this course and we don't have much time to waste, so it's important you get your coding tools set up right away - and start getting familiar with them.

This tutorial will be different in some ways from most other tutorials, in that:

- there is no programming involved, and
- you know ahead of time exactly what is expected of you


## What things are being checked

[Here are the things](what-things-are-checked.md) being checked in this tutorial.

## Instructions

1. [Do these things](things-to-do-beforehand.md) before continuing.
2. [Look through the script](how-things-are-checked.md) JP will use to gauge your readiness.
3. Go to the [GitHub Classroom Links section of the tutorials document](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202201-001/shared-course-material/blob/main/tutorials.md#github-classroom-links) in our GitHub Org.
4. Click on the correct (depending on your tutorial time) link to accept the "assignment". 

    _For all other tutorials, links won't be active until about 5 minutes before the start of tutorial._

5. Clone the accepted repository to your computer.
6. Open the resulting local repository in VS Code.

    _While the repo you clone this time only has a small README, for all other tutorials, there will be a README **and** some starting code available in the cloned repository._

7. When you feel you are ready for JP to walk through [the marking script](how-things-are-checked.md) with you, DM him on Discord and be prepared to share your screen when he is ready to take a look at your work.

## Karma

Tutorials are a good source of ~~fibre~~ karma:

- showing up on time gets you some karma (and continuing to do so *consistently* gets you even more)

- if you've already completed everything _ahead of time_, that will get you a wad of karma

- even if you can only get through _some_ of the marking script in time, you'll still get some karma

## Submitting the tutorial

For this first tutorial, there is nothing to submit (though I **do** want to make sure you can push successfully back to GitHub).

## How much do I need to get done to get max karma?

So what exactly am I looking for when I check your progress? Enough work done in 15+ minutes for me to go, "yeah - I think they came reasonably prepared". I might even ask a very simple question or two to confirm my gut feeling.

That's probably not as precise as you might like, but I'm afraid we're dealing with one of those "I know it when I see it" things.
